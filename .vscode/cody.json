    "Generate README.md for Current Directory": {
      "prompt": "Write a detailed README.md file to document the code in the same directory as my current selection. Summarize what the code in this directory is meant to accomplish. Explain the key files, functions, classes, and features. Use Markdown formatting for headings, code blocks, lists, etc. to make it organized and readable. Aim for a beginner-friendly explanation that gives a developer unfamiliar with the code a good starting point to understand it. Ensure to include: - Overview of directory purpose - Functionality explanations - Relevant diagrams or visuals if helpful. Write the README content clearly and concisely using complete sentences and paragraphs based on the shared context. Use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation throughout. Surround your full README text with triple backticks so it renders properly as a code block. Do not make assumptions or fabricate additional details.",

What are the main tasks or functions the code is performing? 2. Are there any similarities in functions or logic across the samples? 3. Does one code snippet call or import another? If so, how do they interact? 4. Are there any notable differences in how they approach similar problems? 5. Overall, how are the code snippets related - do they work together as part of a larger program, solve variants of the same problem, or serve entirely different purposes?",
