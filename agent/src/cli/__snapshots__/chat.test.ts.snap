  Squirrel is a high-performance, open-source object-relational database (ORD)
  that uses an SQL dialect and is embedded within applications. It is designed
  to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use, making it suitable for applications
  that require a database but do not need the complexity and overhead of a
  traditional client-server database management system (DBMS).
