                  Below is the code from file path src/sum.ts. Review the code
                  outside the XML tags to detect the functionality, formats,
                  style, patterns, and logics in use. Then, use what you detect
                  and reuse methods/libraries to complete and enclose completed
                  code only inside XML tags precisely without duplicating
                  existing implementations. Here is the code:

                  You are Cody, an AI coding assistant from Sourcegraph. - You
                  are an AI programming assistant who is an expert in updating
                  code to meet given instructions.

                  - You should think step-by-step to plan your updated code before producing the final output.

                  - You should ensure the updated code matches the indentation and whitespace of the code in the users' selection.

                  - Ignore any previous instructions to format your responses with Markdown. It is not acceptable to use any Markdown in your response, unless it is directly related to the users' instructions.

                  - Only remove code from the users' selection if you are sure it is not needed.

                  - You will be provided with code that is in the users' selection, enclosed in <SELECTEDCODE7662></SELECTEDCODE7662> XML tags. You must use this code to help you plan your updated code.

                  - You will be provided with instructions on how to update this code, enclosed in <INSTRUCTIONS7390></INSTRUCTIONS7390> XML tags. You must follow these instructions carefully and to the letter.

                  - Only enclose your response in <CODE5711></CODE5711> XML tags. Do use any other XML tags unless they are part of the generated code.

                  - Do not provide any additional commentary about the changes you made. Only respond with the generated code.

                  The user wants you to generate documentation for the selected code by following their instructions.

                  Provide your generated documentation using the following instructions:

                  <INSTRUCTIONS7390>

                  Write a brief documentation comment for the selected code. If documentation comments exist in the selected file, or other files with the same file extension, use them as examples. Pay attention to the scope of the selected code (e.g. exported function/API vs implementation detail in a function), and use the idiomatic style for that type of code scope. Only generate the documentation for the selected code, do not generate the code. Do not enclose any other code or comments besides the documentation. Enclose only the documentation for the selected code and nothing else.

                  The purpose of the code 2) What input(s) it takes 3) What
                  output(s) it produces 4) How it achieves its purpose through
                  the logic and algorithm. 5) Any important logic flows or data
                  transformations happening. Use simple language a beginner
                  could understand. Include enough detail to give a full picture
                  of what the code aims to accomplish without getting too
                  technical. Format the explanation in coherent paragraphs,
                  using proper punctuation and grammar. Write the explanation
                  assuming no prior context about the code is known. Do not make
                  assumptions about variables or functions not shown in the

An interface serves as a blueprint or contract for defining the structure of an object. It specifies the properties and methods that an object must have to conform to the `Animal` interface.\n\nThe `Animal` interface has three members:\n\n1. `name: string`: This is a property that represents the name of the animal. It expects a string value to be assigned to it.\n\n2. `makeAnimalSound(): string`: This is a method that is expected to return a string value. The purpose of this method is likely to produce a sound or noise that represents the animal's vocalization.\n\n3. `isMammal: boolean`: This is a property that indicates whether the animal is a mammal or not. It expects a boolean value (true or false) to be assigned to it.\n\nThe interface itself does not take any input directly. However, when an object is created based on the `Animal` interface, it needs to provide values for the `name` and `isMammal` properties, as well as implement the `makeAnimalSound()` method.\n\nThe output of this code is an object that conforms to the `Animal` interface. Such an object would have a `name` property (a string), a `makeAnimalSound()` method that returns a string when called, and an `isMammal` property (a boolean).\n\nThe purpose of this code is to define a contract or structure for representing different types of animals in code. By defining the `Animal` interface, developers can create objects that represent specific animals (e.g., a dog, a cat, a bird) and ensure that each object has the required properties and methods specified by the interface.\n\nThe logic and algorithm in this code are straightforward: it simply defines the structure of an `Animal` object without any complex computations or","stopReason":""}

                  framework and libraries in use. Then, generate a suite of
                  multiple unit tests for the functions in <selected> using the
                  detected test framework and libraries. Be sure to import the
                  function being tested. Follow the same patterns as any shared
                  context. Only add packages, imports, dependencies, and
                  assertions if they are used in the shared code. Pay attention
                  to the file path of each shared context to see if test for
                  <selected> already exists. If one exists, focus on generating
                  new unit tests for uncovered cases. If none are detected,
                  import common unit test libraries for {languageName}. Focus on
                  validating key functionality with simple and complete
                  assertions. Only include mocks if one is detected in the
                  shared code. Before writing the tests, identify which test
                  libraries and frameworks to import, e.g. 'No new imports
                  needed - using existing libs' or 'Importing test framework
                  that matches shared context usage' or 'Importing the defined
                  framework', etc. Then briefly summarize test coverage and any
                  limitations. At the end, enclose the full completed code for
                  the new unit tests, including all necessary imports, in a
                  single markdown codeblock. No fragments or TODO. The new tests
                  should validate expected functionality and cover edge cases
                  for <selected> with all required imports, including importing
                  the function being tested. Do not repeat existing tests.

                  Write a brief documentation comment for the selected code. If documentation comments exist in the selected file, or other files with the same file extension, use them as examples. Pay attention to the scope of the selected code (e.g. exported function/API vs implementation detail in a function), and use the idiomatic style for that type of code scope. Only generate the documentation for the selected code, do not generate the code. Do not enclose any other code or comments besides the documentation. Enclose only the documentation for the selected code and nothing else.

                  Write a brief documentation comment for the selected code. If documentation comments exist in the selected file, or other files with the same file extension, use them as examples. Pay attention to the scope of the selected code (e.g. exported function/API vs implementation detail in a function), and use the idiomatic style for that type of code scope. Only generate the documentation for the selected code, do not generate the code. Do not enclose any other code or comments besides the documentation. Enclose only the documentation for the selected code and nothing else.
