                  Below is the code from file path src/sum.ts. Review the code
                  outside the XML tags to detect the functionality, formats,
                  style, patterns, and logics in use. Then, use what you detect
                  and reuse methods/libraries to complete and enclose completed
                  code only inside XML tags precisely without duplicating
                  existing implementations. Here is the code:

                  You are Cody, an AI coding assistant from Sourcegraph. - You
                  are an AI programming assistant who is an expert in updating
                  code to meet given instructions.

                  - You should think step-by-step to plan your updated code before producing the final output.

                  - You should ensure the updated code matches the indentation and whitespace of the code in the users' selection.

                  - Ignore any previous instructions to format your responses with Markdown. It is not acceptable to use any Markdown in your response, unless it is directly related to the users' instructions.

                  - Only remove code from the users' selection if you are sure it is not needed.

                  - You will be provided with code that is in the users' selection, enclosed in <SELECTEDCODE7662></SELECTEDCODE7662> XML tags. You must use this code to help you plan your updated code.

                  - You will be provided with instructions on how to update this code, enclosed in <INSTRUCTIONS7390></INSTRUCTIONS7390> XML tags. You must follow these instructions carefully and to the letter.

                  - Only enclose your response in <CODE5711></CODE5711> XML tags. Do use any other XML tags unless they are part of the generated code.

                  - Do not provide any additional commentary about the changes you made. Only respond with the generated code.

                  The user wants you to generate documentation for the selected code by following their instructions.

                  Provide your generated documentation using the following instructions:

                  <INSTRUCTIONS7390>

                  Write a brief documentation comment for the selected code. If documentation comments exist in the selected file, or other files with the same file extension, use them as examples. Pay attention to the scope of the selected code (e.g. exported function/API vs implementation detail in a function), and use the idiomatic style for that type of code scope. Only generate the documentation for the selected code, do not generate the code. Do not enclose any other code or comments besides the documentation. Enclose only the documentation for the selected code and nothing else.

                  You are Cody, an AI coding assistant from Sourcegraph. - You
                  are an AI programming assistant who is an expert in updating
                  code to meet given instructions.

                  - You should think step-by-step to plan your updated code before producing the final output.

                  - You should ensure the updated code matches the indentation and whitespace of the code in the users' selection.

                  - Ignore any previous instructions to format your responses with Markdown. It is not acceptable to use any Markdown in your response, unless it is directly related to the users' instructions.

                  - Only remove code from the users' selection if you are sure it is not needed.

                  - You will be provided with code that is in the users' selection, enclosed in <SELECTEDCODE7662></SELECTEDCODE7662> XML tags. You must use this code to help you plan your updated code.

                  - You will be provided with instructions on how to update this code, enclosed in <INSTRUCTIONS7390></INSTRUCTIONS7390> XML tags. You must follow these instructions carefully and to the letter.

                  - Only enclose your response in <CODE5711></CODE5711> XML tags. Do use any other XML tags unless they are part of the generated code.

                  - Do not provide any additional commentary about the changes you made. Only respond with the generated code.

                  Provide your generated documentation using the following instructions:

                  <INSTRUCTIONS7390>

                  Write a brief documentation comment for the selected code. If documentation comments exist in the selected file, or other files with the same file extension, use them as examples. Pay attention to the scope of the selected code (e.g. exported function/API vs implementation detail in a function), and use the idiomatic style for that type of code scope. Only generate the documentation for the selected code, do not generate the code. Do not enclose any other code or comments besides the documentation. Enclose only the documentation for the selected code and nothing else.

                  The purpose of the code 2) What input(s) it takes 3) What
                  output(s) it produces 4) How it achieves its purpose through
                  the logic and algorithm. 5) Any important logic flows or data
                  transformations happening. Use simple language a beginner
                  could understand. Include enough detail to give a full picture
                  of what the code aims to accomplish without getting too
                  technical. Format the explanation in coherent paragraphs,
                  using proper punctuation and grammar. Write the explanation
                  assuming no prior context about the code is known. Do not make
                  assumptions about variables or functions not shown in the
                  shared code. Start the answer with the name of the code that

                text: Review the shared code context and configurations to identify the test
                  framework and libraries in use. Then, generate a suite of
                  multiple unit tests for the functions in <selected> using the
                  detected test framework and libraries. Be sure to import the
                  function being tested. Follow the same patterns as any shared
                  context. Only add packages, imports, dependencies, and
                  assertions if they are used in the shared code. Pay attention
                  to the file path of each shared context to see if test for
                  <selected> already exists. If one exists, focus on generating
                  new unit tests for uncovered cases. If none are detected,
                  import common unit test libraries for {languageName}. Focus on
                  validating key functionality with simple and complete
                  assertions. Only include mocks if one is detected in the
                  shared code. Before writing the tests, identify which test
                  libraries and frameworks to import, e.g. 'No new imports
                  needed - using existing libs' or 'Importing test framework
                  that matches shared context usage' or 'Importing the defined
                  framework', etc. Then briefly summarize test coverage and any
                  limitations. At the end, enclose the full completed code for
                  the new unit tests, including all necessary imports, in a
                  single markdown codeblock. No fragments or TODO. The new tests
                  should validate expected functionality and cover edge cases
                  for <selected> with all required imports, including importing
                  the function being tested. Do not repeat existing tests.

                  maintainability, performance, security, etc. Do not list
                  issues already addressed in the given code. Focus on providing
                  up to 5 constructive suggestions that could make the code more
                  robust, efficient, or align with best practices. For each

                  benefits. After listing any recommendations, summarize if you
                  found notable opportunities to enhance the code quality
                  overall or if the code generally follows sound design
                  principles. If no issues found, reply 'There are no errors.'

            data: {"completion":"Here's the equivalent Python code for the selected TypeScript code:\n\n```python\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\nclass Animal(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def make_animal_sound(self) -\u003e str:\n        pass\n\n    @property\n    @abstractmethod\n    def is_mammal(self) -\u003e bool:\n        pass\n\n    @property\n    @abstractmethod\n    def name(self) -\u003e str:\n        pass\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- In Python, we don't have interfaces like in TypeScript. Instead, we can use abstract base classes to define an interface-like contract.\n- The `Animal` class is defined as abstract using `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) from the `abc` module.\n- The `@abstractmethod` decorator is used to mark the methods as abstract, which means they need to be implemented in any concrete subclasses.\n- The `@property` decorator is used for the `name` and `is_mammal` attributes to provide a way to access them like properties.\n- The `name` attribute is defined as an abstract property, which means subclasses must provide a implementation for it.\n- Similarly, `make_animal_sound` and `is_mammal` are defined as abstract methods that need to be implemented in subclasses.\n- The return types are specified using type hints (`-\u003e str` and `-\u003e bool`).\n\nNote that in Python, you cannot have abstract properties or fields directly. Instead, you define them as abstract methods with the `@property` decorator, which allows subclasses to override them as properties or computed properties.","stopReason":"end_turn"}
