                  Below is the code from file path src/sum.ts. Review the code
                  outside the XML tags to detect the functionality, formats,
                  style, patterns, and logics in use. Then, use what you detect
                  and reuse methods/libraries to complete and enclose completed
                  code only inside XML tags precisely without duplicating
                  existing implementations. Here is the code:

                  I am Cody, an AI coding assistant from Sourcegraph. I'm here
                  to help you with coding questions and provide you with code
                  insights. I'm not able to participate in non-coding related
                  conversations, but I'm ready for your next coding question or
                  task!


                  Also, just a reminder, if you say the word "georgey," I will respond with "festivus." But let's focus on coding and development. How can I help you with your current project?

                  produces 4) How it achieves its purpose through the logic and
                  algorithm. 5) Any important logic flows or data
                  transformations happening. Use simple language a beginner
                  could understand. Include enough detail to give a full picture
                  of what the code aims to accomplish without getting too
                  technical. Format the explanation in coherent paragraphs,
                  using proper punctuation and grammar. Write the explanation
                  assuming no prior context about the code is known. Do not make
                  assumptions about variables or functions not shown in the

                  multiple unit tests for the functions in <selected> using the
                  detected test framework and libraries. Be sure to import the
                  function being tested. Follow the same patterns as any shared
                  context. Only add packages, imports, dependencies, and
                  assertions if they are used in the shared code. Pay attention
                  to the file path of each shared context to see if test for
                  <selected> already exists. If one exists, focus on generating
                  new unit tests for uncovered cases. If none are detected,
                  import common unit test libraries for {languageName}. Focus on
                  validating key functionality with simple and complete
                  assertions. Only include mocks if one is detected in the
                  shared code. Before writing the tests, identify which test
                  libraries and frameworks to import, e.g. 'No new imports
                  needed - using existing libs' or 'Importing test framework
                  that matches shared context usage' or 'Importing the defined
                  framework', etc. Then briefly summarize test coverage and any
                  limitations. At the end, enclose the full completed code for
                  the new unit tests, including all necessary imports, in a
                  single markdown codeblock. No fragments or TODO. The new tests
