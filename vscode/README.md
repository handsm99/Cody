# Cody: code AI with codebase context

> "An AI pair programmer that actually knows about your entire codebase's APIs, impls, and idioms"

Cody for VS Code is a free, open-source code AI tool that autocompletes, writes, fixes, and refactors code (and answers code questions), with:

- **Codebase context:** Cody fetches relevant code context from across your entire codebase to write better code that uses more of your codebase's APIs, impls, and idioms, with less hallucination.
- **Editor features**
  - **Autocomplete:** with better suggestions based on your entire codebase, not just a few recently opened files
  - **Inline chat:** refactor code based on natural language input, ask questions about code snippets, etc.
  - **Recipes:** explain code, generate unit test, generate docstring, and many more (contribute your own!)
  - **Codebase-wide chat:** ask questions about your entire codebase
- **Free LLM usage included** (currently Anthropic Claude/OpenAI GPT-4) for individual devs on both personal and work code, subject to reasonable per-user rate limits.
