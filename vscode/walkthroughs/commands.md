Cody can explain code, generate unit tests, add documentation, and more, by leveraging its full awareness of your codebase. You can also build your own [Custom Commands (Beta)](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/capabilities/commands#custom-commands) to tailor Cody to your workflow.

To get started, select a command from the [Cody: Commands Menu](command:cody.action.commands.menu), or simply open up a chat window and type `/`.
